# Healthcare-Workforce-Mental-Health-Analysis
Exploring the factors that influences the mental health of Healthcare employees

## Objective: 

To analyze key factors that contribute to high burnout and turnover rates in the 
healthcare workforce, identifying departments, job roles, and workplace conditions 
that are most at risk. 

## Key Questions: 

1. Which job roles and departments experience the highest stress and burnout 
rates? 
2. How does burnout frequency affect job satisfaction and turnover intention?
   
4. What workplace factors contribute most to mental health absences?
   
5. Do employees with access to Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) show 
lower burnout and absenteeism rates.

## Dataset Insights for the Case Study 
✔ Burnout & Stress by Job Role: 

● Employees in ICU, General Medicine, and Outpatient Services report the highest stress 
levels. 

● Heavy Workload is the leading stress factor for clinical roles, while Career Stagnation is a major issue for administrators. 

✔ Burnout's Impact on Job Satisfaction & Turnover: 

● Employees experiencing burnout often report low job satisfaction.

● 43% of employees show high burnout, with turnover rates significantly higher 
among this group. 

✔ Mental Health Absences & EAP Access: 

● Employees without access to EAPs take more mental health-related absences. 

● The correlation suggests that providing EAPs could help mitigate workforce 
burnout. 

✔ Turnover Intention Predictors: 

● Employees with stress levels of 7-10 and weak job satisfaction are at highest risk 
of leaving. 

● Turnover risks are most significant in General Medicine and Outpatient services. 


### **Conclusion:**

1. **High Stress Levels in Clinical Roles:** Employees in high-stress roles, particularly in **ICU**, **General Medicine**, and **Outpatient Services**, experience the most burnout, with a direct impact on job satisfaction and overall well-being. Clinical roles report heavy workloads as a key stress factor, which could be contributing to these high stress levels.

2. **Career Stagnation Among Administrators:** For administrative staff, **career stagnation** is a primary source of stress, indicating that job growth opportunities and career development might be lacking in these roles.

3. **Burnout's Impact on Job Satisfaction & Turnover:** There is a clear link between burnout and **low job satisfaction**, with **43% of employees** experiencing high burnout. This group exhibits significantly higher turnover intentions, suggesting burnout directly influences employee retention.

4. **Mental Health Absences & EAP Access:** Employees without access to **Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs)** tend to take more mental health-related absences, highlighting that **EAPs** could play a crucial role in supporting employees' mental well-being and potentially reducing burnout.

5. **Turnover Risk Indicators:** Employees with high stress (rated 7-10) and low job satisfaction are most likely to leave. The **General Medicine** and **Outpatient Services** departments have the highest turnover risk, indicating a need for targeted interventions in these areas.

### **Recommendations:**

1. **Targeted Stress Management Programs for Clinical Roles:** 
   - **ICU**, **General Medicine**, and **Outpatient Services** should implement **stress management programs** to address heavy workloads and help employees manage stress. These could include team support systems, adequate staffing levels, and training in time management and self-care strategies.

2. **Career Development for Administrators:**
   - To combat **career stagnation**, provide **career development opportunities**, mentorship programs, and clear career progression pathways for administrative employees. Regular reviews of career advancement opportunities can help reduce stress caused by the lack of growth.

3. **Address Burnout Early:**
   - Implement **early intervention strategies** to identify and address burnout before it affects job satisfaction. Managers should encourage open dialogue about workload and job satisfaction, offer flexible work options where possible, and promote a culture of support and recognition.

4. **Expand EAP Access:**
   - Ensure that all employees have access to **Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs)**, particularly in departments experiencing high stress. EAPs can provide counseling, mental health support, and stress-relief resources that could reduce absenteeism and burnout.

5. **Retaining High-Risk Employees:**
   - Focus on **retaining employees** in departments with the highest turnover risks (**General Medicine** and **Outpatient Services**) by addressing their specific stressors. Consider improving working conditions, providing adequate breaks, and increasing staffing levels to reduce workload pressure.

6. **Implementing Well-being Surveys:**
   - Regularly conduct **employee well-being surveys** to monitor stress levels, job satisfaction, and burnout. Use this data to tailor interventions, track progress over time, and continuously improve employee retention strategies.

7. **Workload Management & Staffing Solutions:**
   - In departments where **heavy workloads** are a leading stress factor, consider **optimizing staffing levels** or introducing better task distribution methods. Automation or additional support roles might alleviate pressure on frontline staff.

By addressing these areas, the organization can improve employee well-being, reduce burnout, and enhance retention across departments.
