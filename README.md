# Healthcare-Workforce-Mental-Health-Analysis
Exploring the factors that influences the mental health of Healthcare employees

## Objective: 

To analyze key factors that contribute to high burnout and turnover rates in the 
healthcare workforce, identifying departments, job roles, and workplace conditions 
that are most at risk. 

## Key Questions: 

1. Which job roles and departments experience the highest stress and burnout 
rates? 
2. How does burnout frequency affect job satisfaction and turnover intention?
   
4. What workplace factors contribute most to mental health absences?
   
5. Do employees with access to Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) show 
lower burnout and absenteeism rates.

## Dataset Insights for the Case Study 
✔ Burnout & Stress by Job Role: 

● Employees in ICU, General Medicine, and Outpatient Services report the highest stress 
levels. 

● Heavy Workload is the leading stress factor for clinical roles, while Career Stagnation is a major issue for administrators. 

✔ Burnout's Impact on Job Satisfaction & Turnover: 

● Employees experiencing burnout often report low job satisfaction.

● 43% of employees show high burnout, with turnover rates significantly higher 
among this group. 

✔ Mental Health Absences & EAP Access: 

● Employees without access to EAPs take more mental health-related absences. 

● The correlation suggests that providing EAPs could help mitigate workforce 
burnout. 

✔ Turnover Intention Predictors: 

● Employees with stress levels of 7-10 and weak job satisfaction are at highest risk 
of leaving. 

● Turnover risks are most significant in General Medicine and Outpatient services. 



### Applications of the Case Study 

 Workforce Retention Strategies: Hospitals can use these insights to develop 
targeted interventions for high-burnout departments. 

 HR & Mental Health Policies: Data suggests that expanding EAP access could 
reduce absenteeism and burnout rates. 

 Operational Improvements: Adjusting workloads in General Medicine and Outpatient Services department
may improve staff retention and satisfaction.
